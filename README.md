## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* Windows 10-11 or any windows version compatible with .NET Framework 4.7.2
* .NET Framework 4.7.2 (it's installed by default)
* A brain

### Using It

* Open the executable file.
* Depending on the option you choose it'll either add, remove or view current accounts.
* If you want to add an account choose your username and make sure it's 3-16 characters long and doesn't contain special characters or multiplayer won't work (click [here](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-java-edition/suggestions/3007464-minecraft-username-rules) for further info).
* Then choose a UUID of a player that has the skin you want by going to [NameMC](https://namemc.com/) and picking your preferred one.
* That's basically it.

## Help

If it doesn't work make sure you have Lunar Client installed and ran any version of Lunar Client or make sure to run the program as administrator.
